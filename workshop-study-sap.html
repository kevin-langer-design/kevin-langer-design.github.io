			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Fiori is the UX experience from SAP aimed at increasing usability and workflow. Helping to run a workshop, we lead several clients through user development exercises and process solutions. The goal of the workshop was to help clients solve particular challenges they might be facing and to get them hooked into user centered design. </p>

			<h2>Point of View</h2>
			<p>For the team I was helping out we were taking a look at their Service Agent workflow. The team wanted to refine the process and better meet SLA (Service Level Agreement) guidelines. We started with a Point of View exercise to note down the tasks, challenges, and possible improvements we can make. This was our chance to just brainstorm and clear our minds of the first thoughts we had regarding this problem. Discussing all the notes we voted on the items we wanted to move forward with and refine further, which brought us to the User Persona.</p>

			<h2>Personal Development</h2>
			<p>To understand how to improve the workflow we really needed to get at the heart of who was in it, the user. From their perspective, we jotted down everything they would think, see, hear, along with what their pains were and what their gains were. This created empathy for the user and helped us to better understand the world which they lived in. Focusing on what we discovered, we voted on some key notes to work on and moved into the next phase of learning how our user accomplishes all that they do.</p>

			<h2>Journey Map</h2>
			<p>Here is where we laid out the timeline for the user to accomplish their tasks. But instead of just recording everything they do we evaluated their emotional impact, stakeholders they worked with, and personal goals they could achieve along the way. Completing a whole picture into the process instead of just listing out tasks gives us a better understanding for where we could improve the process.</p>

			<h2>Understanding Iterations</h2>
			<p>Along the way in understanding the specifics of each client's problems we interspersed exercises to help understand and innovate the whole UX process. One such exercise was one hand paper airplanes. In the task groups are asked to make a paper airplane but they can only use one hand and must work with their group to make the folds. Being timeboxed the task sounds simple but can be challenging. At the end we have a competition to see who can fly the furthest. The key takeaway here is groups that spend their time iterating and making a second or third version of their airplane will create a better product that wins the competition. With fresh and fun lessons in the workshop attendee's mind we return to our tasks more mindful of our process. <a href="https://experience.sap.com/skillup/warm-ups-one-hand-paper-airplanes/" target="_blank">Take a look at a blog post I wrote on this exercise.</a></p>

			<h2>How Might We</h2>
			<p>Now that we understand the user and their process, we wanted to take a look into refining the Service Agent Workflow. Posing questions in the form of "How Might We", we worked on coming up with solutions. This is a quick way of working through possible solutions big or small. Reflecting on the persona and journey map we were able to hone in on issues that need the most attention or could possibly open up a better solution for the workflow. Holding discussions on which ideas helps the user and the workflow the most we voted on the solutions to iterate on.</p>

			<h2>Storyboard</h2>
			<p>Now that we have ideas for creating a better workflow and user experience, how would this work in the user's journey? To understand this better we created storyboard examples where the user would be working with the possible solutions. This helps us understand how different solution methods affect the user.</p>

			<h2>Lo-fi Wireframes</h2>
			<p>With the ideas on what we want to do for the user we needed to visualize how that would look in a product form. Normally we would want to create higher fidelity mocks to see our solutions better, but given this is a timed workshop we created lo-fi wireframes. Quickly sketched mocks on paper showed the new workflow for the user in the product. Here we could quickly see if something was viable or not and could make another sketch if something didn't seem to be working or needed to be iterated on. This allowed us to see if our goal for the new user processes could translate to functional product solutions.</p>

			<h2>Share Out</h2>
			<p>At the end of the workshop we took all of our work and created a short presentation to share out with everyone. This gave us a chance to shine and show off our hard work, but also to see how others tackled their problems and what solutions they came up with. Taking the work we did at the workshop the clients would go back to their offices to refine and iterate on them more so they could implement their new workflows into production. The best part was the client learning the benefits of user centered design and taking that knowledge back with them.</p>
